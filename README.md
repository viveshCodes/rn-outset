# rn-outset
This repository contains the basic concepts to get started with React Native. 
 ## Why is this repo created
 I like to code along the concepts while learning new concepts. I organized the basic concepts of React native in this repository which will act as a foundation for learning advanced concepts.
 ## Is there any react native application?
 Yes, it does. There is a folder called ``tutorial`` which will help to understand the very basics of RN. It will take half an hour to a hour to go through the concepts. 
 Having understood tutorial (which can also be skipped), one can run the repo to see a sample mobile application.
